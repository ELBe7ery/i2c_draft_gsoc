## Communication protocols

+ **Perfect understanding** of the I2C communication protocol, Have made [my own I2C slave module on FPGA](https://github.com/ELBe7ery/i2c_draft_gsoc/tree/master/I2c%20slave) from scratch which required 
intensively studying the whole protocol. I am also able use the I2C on Arduino platform and the cortexM4.
+ **Fair understanding** of the UART communication protocol, able to use the UART on Arduino platform and the cortexM4
+ Able to write code that make use of the cortexM4 internal peripherals such as **Systick** and the **GPIO** 

## Microcontrollers and modules
+ Able to write **C** or **THUMB2 Assembly** code for the **cortexM4**
+ Very good knowledge of the arduino platform 
+ Hands on the [Photon IOT](https://store.particle.io/products/photon)
+ Able to build applications around the **ESP8266** wifi module, **HC-05** bluetooth module and **NRF2l01** RF chip

## Projects

+ **iHub 2015** We have built a hardware software solution for home automation. The project was built on the **ATMega32** microcontroller 
surrounded by many peripherals such as **ESP8266 WIFI module** and **NRF24L01**, and the user can
interact with the board via a mobile and a desktop application. We hade the **Best Engineering design Award and 5th place**

+ **PI student activity** A hardware software solution for students who wants to study circuits without buying an expensive scope. The
product was using the **ATTiny85** microcontroller and was connected to the PC via the serial interface module and provide the reading on
the desktop software ![Pic1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELBe7ery/University-Projects/master/PIplotter/Screenshots/11884026_1035172149834659_5246873312351402315_o.jpg)

+ **STP solar challange**. A solar car that had an **embedded controller** that was built using Arduino UNO
. The controller fully controlles the car 4 motors and steering servo via a mobile software.
We had the **3rd place** during STP solar race
